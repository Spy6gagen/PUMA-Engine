Alr now I want to edit it a bit so we need a 
level designer so you can actually curate a map. 
Specifically i want it to add lights, physics, models, texture, and vietpoints. 
We will have a basic  first person controller. Models will be able to have custom scripts
placed in them. Specifically you gotta have a xml file that will store all the 
infomation about the level with the script's file location linked + model.
